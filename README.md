## Weather API

this project is written with `reactjs`

### Frontend
I used  `react-router-dom` and other third party libraries (like Bootstrap) for setting up UI.


we can save the data to **localStorage** with `localStorage.setItem()` and
prevent from requesting every time  and getting data after `10 minutes` 
based on the requirements (pdf file). I didn't have enough time 
to complete the `caching mechanism` 



###Backend
As I told you before, I didn't have enough experience with `Symfony 3` syntax to complete 
the project on desired time.
I Spent most of my time connecting to *Postgres database*.


If I got more time (about 1-2 days) for learning the **Symfony** syntax it certainly would be 
better than this.
