## Weather API

this project is written with `reactjs`

### Frontend
I used  `react-router-dom` and other third party libraries (like Bootstrap) for setting up UI.


we can use **Redux** for storing our global states.
for each server request beside saving the objects, we also store the `last_fetched_time` 
to prevent from requesting every time and getting data after `10 minutes` 
based on the requirements (pdf file). I didn't have enough time 
to complete the `caching mechanism`
